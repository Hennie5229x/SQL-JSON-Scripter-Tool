# SQL-JSON-Scripter-Tool
SQL Table data to JSON and back to SQL

This is a neat little tool I wrote that helped me bring over large amounts of data from our clients live system to our dev system.
This was specifically helpful where backing up the database was not an option (because there is not enough space and/or time consuming) or a SQL Data script was too large for SQL Management Studio to process.


Basic Overview:

Start by Connecting to your SQL Server:

Select a Table and Create a Data Table: (Or Use the Multiple Tables Button)

You can now view the raw data or create the JSON file.

After creating the JSON file you can now use that file to populate your table:
Now create a Data Table from the JSON file and ensure you select the correct Table to insert the data.
